### Project Background
Let's take a look at these two situations:

> - Imagine you are on a family trip. After sitting on the plane for 6 hours, dragging all the luggages to the hotel, you are extremely exhausted and don't have any strength to make travel plan. <br>
> - Imagine you have happily made the travel plan, but when you arrive at a famous attraction only to find hundreds of thousands of tourists, you feel disappointed and only want to visit somewhere quiet but worth a visit. 

Does any of these describe you during a trip? In order to help people truly relax and acquire happiness, I started off this ***Trip Generator*** app project during a [Serverless Mentorship Program](https://www.bitproject.org/serverless) hosted by Bit Project.
